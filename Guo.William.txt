1) Notes and examples from class that were helpful for completing the classwork included
the diagrams on the board which outlined how super() worked for overriding previous methods
and also the 'this.varname' which refered to the private variables in class.
2) Although we finished writing out all of the code and ran the tests, the only thing we didn't
finish was answering the question at the very end. In terms of progress wise, I would say
that we did pretty well but I think that because we didn't maximize the usage of our windows,
we had to flip back and forth between the browser and atom and also because we were both too focused
on just one screen instead of using the other monitor that we had. (This is more of a problem
that we caused ourselves...)
